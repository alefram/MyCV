Dear Mr Anthony.\\

I am elated to submit my application for the Embedded System Engineer position at Samsara in response to the job opening posted on your webpage. I am an Electrical Engineer with a minor in Electronics and Control Systems, and I believe I will be a valuable asset to your team. \\

During my career at Central University of Venezuela, I worked on several projects using Python and C++, including my Bachelor's thesis where I delved into deep learning. I also engaged in robot simulation with Mujoco and applied reinforcement learning to control the robot arm articulation. Additionally, I served as an Assistant Professor in the Digital Systems and Microprocessors labs, overseeing laboratory operations, instructing students in microcontroller management and digital system design, as well as conducting research and developing new tools for these labs, such as an interface for creating logic circuits using a microcontroller.

On the other hand, I have been working as a full-stack Software Developer with different groups and projects like MoonGuard. MoonGuard is a set of tools used to monitor and debug Laravel applications, which has more than 1000 users. Additionally, I have worked on a UAV simulation project to test various control systems for monitoring transmission lines and web applications.

I believe I would make an excellent addition to your team. look forward to hearing from you!\\

Sincerely,\\
Alexis Fraudita
