Dear Mr Tom.\\

I am elated to submit my application for the Software Engineer internship 
Program at Deepmind Technologies, in response to the job opening posted on yours 
Webpage. I am undergraduate Electrical Engineer Student, in my final year of 
study doing my on thesis in Reinforcement Learning applied to Robotic Manipulation, 
and also Assistant Professor of the Digital Systems and Microprocessors classes, 
and I believe I will be a worthy asset to your team. \\

During my career at Central University of Venezuela, I have completed a great 
deal of coursework, including Linear systems analysis, Probability and 
control theory, where I learned the fundamentals of control systems and design 
of digital systems for applications like DC motor control. In addition, I did 
several projects using the Python language
, including my Bachelor thesis where I have been learning about deep learning,
Robot simulation with Mujoco and Reinforcement Learning applied to the control 
of the Robot arm articulation for develop a framework for building smart 
controllers in robot manipulators. Also currently, I am the Assistant Professor 
of the Digital Systems and Microprocessors subjects, where I take care of the 
laboratories, teaching the students in the management of microcontrollers and 
design of digital systems and researching and developing new tools for these 
Labs like an interface for the creation of logic circuits using a microcontroller. 
Finally, as extracurricular practices, I have been working as full-stack Software 
Developer with different groups in freelancers and a startup call 
Swim(https://swimapp.io/) where is an Ios app to connect places to the digital 
world and create networks for students from NYU and Columbia to interact in the 
real world. \\

Deepmind has always inspired me with big breakthroughs like Alphafold, Alphago, 
fusion control systems and robotics research, to continue learning about
Artificial Intelligence with the objective to help humanity and improve scientific
discoveries. I believe I would make an excellent addition to your team, and this 
internship would help me grow my real-world experience in the AI industry and 
help me further develop and refine my research and development skills.\\

I look forward to hearing from you!\\

Sincerely,\\
Alexis Fraudita
